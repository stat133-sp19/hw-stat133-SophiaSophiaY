Binomial Distribution /n
The Binomial distribution is perhaps the most famous probability distribution among discrete random variables. This is the theoretical probability model that we use when calculating probabilities about the number of successes in a fixed number of random trials performed under identical conditions (assuming a constant probability of success on each trial).
A classic example of a binomial random variable X involves the number of Heads (or Tails) that you get when tossing a coin n ≥ 0 times. Say you are interested in finding the probability of getting three heads in four tosses of a fair coin: P(X = 3 heads in 4 tosses). To find the answer, we use the formula of the binomial probability:
􏰀n􏰁 Pr(X=k)= k pk(1−p)n−k
where:
• n is the number of (fixed) trials (n ≥ 0)
• p is the probability of success on each trial (0 ≤ p ≤ 1)
• 1 − p is the probability of failure on each trial
• k is a variable that represents the number of successes out of n trials (0 ≤ k ≤ n)
• the first term in parenthesis is NOT a fraction, it is the number of combinations in
which k success can occur in n trials
