The purpose of this assignment is to create a shiny app that allows student to visualize—in an interactive way—some of the saving/investing scenarios considered in warmup 6. The idea is to implement an app for the saving-investing modalities descriped in our section 4 of lab warmup6. These scenarios are the three mode of investment, and student can use the data from warmup 06 to build a investment modeling shiny app.
